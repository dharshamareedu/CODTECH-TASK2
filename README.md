### Objective:
The **Hospital Management System** aims to streamline and automate hospital operations, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in managing patient data, appointments, billing, inventory, and staff information. It serves as a centralized system to facilitate coordination between various hospital departments and improve overall patient care.

### Key Activities:
1. **Patient Registration**:
   - Register new patients and store demographic and health details.
   
2. **Appointment Scheduling**:
   - Schedule, view, and update appointments between patients and doctors.
   
3. **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**:
   - Store and manage patients' medical histories, diagnoses, and treatments.
   
4. **Billing and Invoicing**:
   - Generate and manage bills for medical treatments and services provided.
   
5. **Inventory Management**:
   - Track and manage medical supplies, including adding new stock and viewing inventory levels.
   
6. **Staff Management**:
   - Maintain information about hospital staff, including roles, responsibilities, and shifts.

### Technologies Used:
1. **Programming Language**: Java
   - Utilizing **Generics** to create reusable classes for handling different types of hospital data (patients, doctors, supplies).
   - Using **Reflection** for dynamic loading of different modules (e.g., appointment system, billing system) based on user input.
   
2. **Data Structures**: 
   - Lists and Maps for managing patient records, appointments, and inventory.
   
3. **File Handling**:
   - Java I/O and Serialization for saving and loading patient data, inventory, and billing information.
   
4. **Database Integration** (optional for scalability):
   - Integration with databases like MySQL or SQLite for persistent storage of records.
   
5. **User Interface**: 
   - Command-line interface for basic interactions, with the potential for expansion to a web-based or graphical user interface.
